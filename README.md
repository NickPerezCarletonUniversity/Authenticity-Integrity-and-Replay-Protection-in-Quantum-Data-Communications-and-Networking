# Authenticity-Integrity-and-Replay-Protection-in-Quantum-Data-Communications-and-Networking
The code for generating the simulation results seen in 'Authenticity, Integrity and Replay Protection in Quantum Data Communications and Networking', accepted for publication in the 'ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing journal'. I will update the readme once the paper is released to the public.

Please cite our paper if you decide to use this code.
